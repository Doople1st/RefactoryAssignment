# Sorting Problem

The code's solution is in [here](https://github.com/Doople1st/RefactoryAssignment/blob/master/Sorting.js)

# Simple Client-Server app

- [Client](https://github.com/Doople1st/RefactoryAssignment/blob/master/Client.js) code will send post request to server with najax module
- [Logger](https://github.com/Doople1st/RefactoryAssignment/blob/master/Logger.js) will do logging system for every request to route "/" with using bunyan module.
- [Server](https://github.com/Doople1st/RefactoryAssignment/blob/master/Server.js) code build by express module and body parser to retieve the request body from client.
